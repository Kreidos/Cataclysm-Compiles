# Cataclysm-Compiles
Various Binary builds for the roguelike Cataclysm-DDA.

All builds are compiled against stable releases of Cataclysm DDA for architectures other than x86/x86_64.


    Q: How do I run this?
    A: Download the tar.gz, extract with "tar -zxvf %filename%" and run with ./cataclysm.

    Q: Can you compile me a newer version / nightly?
    A: Right now I only build releases marked "Stable". If a newer stable release comes from the Cataclysm devs, maybe; We'll see.
